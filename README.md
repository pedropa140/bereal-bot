<h1>BeReal-Bot</h1>

## Description
Welcome to BeReal-Bot! ðŸ‘‹ This bot is designed to capture authentic moments, just like the BeReal app. Every day, at a random time, youâ€™ll be prompted to share a photo that showcases your true selfâ€”no filters, no edits! ðŸ“¸âœ¨

## How It Works

  **Random Moment:**  
   Youâ€™ll receive a notification at a surprise time.

  **Snap a Pic:**  
   Youâ€™ll have 2 minutes to take a photo of what youâ€™re doing right at that moment. Itâ€™s all about being real!

  **Share & Connect:**  
   After you snap your pic, you can share them with friends and see their moments too. Letâ€™s keep it genuine!

## Remember
Itâ€™s not about the likes; itâ€™s about capturing life as it is. So get ready to embrace the spontaneity! ðŸŽ‰
Feel free to modify any sections as needed!
